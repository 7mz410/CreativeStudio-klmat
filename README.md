## Built on WordCraft

klmat is a fork of **[WordCraft](https://github.com/storytold/wordcraft)**, the open-source, clean-room
application written in Rust by the **[ArtCraft](https://getartcraft.com/)** team and the WordCraft
contributors. Almost everything that makes this app work is their work. Thank you. If you like
klmat, please star and support the upstream project as well.

What we add: the Creative Studio identity, the Arabic interface laid out right to left, and Arabic
features to come. Our changes are listed in [`studio/CHANGES.md`](studio/CHANGES.md).
Upstream's own README, with the full feature list and build instructions, is in
[`docs/UPSTREAM-README.md`](docs/UPSTREAM-README.md).
